Explain the key differences between linear regression and logistic regression. When would you use each?
What is the purpose of the confusion matrix in assessing logistic regression model performance? Describe its components.
Define the coefficient of determination (R-squared) in linear regression. How is it interpreted?
What are some common diagnostic plots used for linear regression models? Explain what each plot reveals about the model.
Describe the concept of "regression to the mean". How does it relate to residuals in a regression model?
What are the main limitations of linear regression when dealing with binary response variables?
Explain the advantages of logistic regression for modeling binary outcomes compared to linear regression.
How is the odds ratio interpreted in logistic regression? Why is it useful?
Define and explain the difference between sensitivity and specificity in the context of logistic regression performance evaluation.
What is the log-odds ratio (logit) in logistic regression? How does it relate to probability?
Describe the process of making predictions with logistic regression models. How do you determine the most likely outcome?
What is the residual standard error (RSE) in linear regression? How is it calculated and interpreted?
Explain the concept of leverage in regression analysis. How does it relate to identifying influential observations?
What is multicollinearity in regression? How can it affect model interpretation and performance?
Describe the process of extrapolation in linear regression. What are the potential risks associated with making predictions outside the range of the training data?
How do you interpret the coefficients in a linear regression model with categorical variables?
Explain the concept of heteroscedasticity in linear regression. How can it be detected and addressed?
What is the purpose of transforming variables in linear regression? Provide examples of common transformations and when they might be used.
Describe the differences between R-squared and adjusted R-squared. When would you prefer to use adjusted R-squared?
What is the purpose of the Scale-Location plot in diagnostic checks for linear regression? What does it reveal about the model?
